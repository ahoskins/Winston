	We built Winston and its backing service, classtime, while undergraduates at the University of Alberta. <br>It served thousands of students over its two year lifespan, but we have now graduated and moved onward to new things. <br><br/>

	If anyone is interested in reviving the project, everything is available on Github at the links below:<br><br>
